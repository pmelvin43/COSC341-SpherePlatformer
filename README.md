## Project Report

### Introduction

This sphere platformer project was completed independently, I encountered little techincal challenge throughout the process and found it to 
be a very fun project with hopes to continue using unity.


### Project Overview

The goal of the project was to create a simple platforming game involving a player controlled object (in this case a pill shaped 3D object) that must
jump across platforms until it reaches an end goal (a flag), all while avoiding enemies (rectangles) and collecting coins (yellow spheres). 
I was responsible for all aspects of the lab, including planning, development, and testing.

### Task Breakdown

As I worked independently on this project, I did not have to collaborate or divide tasks among group members. Instead, I organized my workflow to efficiently manage my time and resources. The primary tasks included:

1. **Planning**: I started by watching the provided tutorial on youtube and walking through it until completing what was shown, and then continuing by adding on what I needed to meet
				the criteria through the new skills I had just learned.
2. **Development**: I implemented the all core functionalities of the required criteria.
3. **Testing**: I conducted play testing throughout development to ensure all features properly functioned.

### Challenges and Solutions

While the lab proceeded smoothly overall, there were a few minor challenges:

1. **[Challenge 1]**: Initially, I faced issues with adding movement to the enemy between a set boundary. To overcome this, I actually went to chatGPT to ask and find out how to remove physics from the enemies so that								
	 gravity did not effect them and so I could set a desired velocity for the desired movement.
2. **[Challenge 2]**: Another issue was also adding collision to the enemies so that it removed a point from the player. I resolved this by using the knowledge I had gained on how I did this fo		r
the coin collection and made it use the same collision method on my new enemy object.

### Conclusion

Completing this project independently allowed me to enhance my skills in unity, and I am satisfied with the final outcome. The experience was valuable and furthered my understanding of object oriented programming.

I look forward to applying these learnings to future projects and continuing to develop my abilities.
